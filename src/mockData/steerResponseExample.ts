I prefer smaller bag in addition to bigger one
Nothing. I'm quite happy with what's available
Maybe some smaller sizes
Cheaper price please
I buy spinach all the time and can't improve on my recipes
Quite happy with current offering small bags for one meal or large bags for 2 portions for 2 meals.
Maybe recipes or advice on how to cook it on the packets
Nothing I can think of
Sometimes I see the spinach sold in bags has a lot of sweat in it which means it won’t last as long
Longer shelf life or cheaper price/deals
"Sainsburys isn't my main shop, but smaller bags probably"
I don't know.  I don't know what it is like at the moment.
More of the product to cook
Longer shelf life and better price
Perhaps more focus on sustainability and recipe ideas
The bag should be increased by a little
I’m happy to buy it as it currently is
I would buy it regardless
More greens I would say
Nothing I am happy with the current offerings
"I already love it, and I am going to buy it. It has everything I want, the health benefits and good value"
I guess we are doing ok currently
Better instructions on cooking
I can’t think of anything
Better discounted prices
Nothing to be honest
Maybe a few more promotions
Perhaps lower prices.
Better use by dates and smaller bags
Make it cheaper to buy
I don't like spinach so wouldn't buy it anyway.
Ready to eat without washing would be good &- smaller bags of spinach
Prices should be lower
I normally purchase frozen spinach which I prefer but would purchase fresh if it had a longer shelf date
Nothing needs to be improved. I buy spinach from Sainsbury’s and don’t have any problem with it at all.
Nothing as l don’t like spinach
Sizes if packaging as it’s either too little or too much
"Fresh, loose spinach. Not in a plastic bag, which causes spinach to sweat and go off faster"
"Have smaller bags that would be enough for 1-2 meals for single households. Or a longer shelf life for bigger bags, once opened."
Knowing more ways to use it
It could be made smaller portions as I never use it all
Smaller bags so less waste and less plastic
I do prefer to buy spinach that has already been washed other than that I don’t need gimics to make me buy fresh spinach
Give meal options to have it with.
"Nothing atall,I buy spinach at least once every week from Sainsbury's."
Better freshness definitely
Nothing can make me buy more I buy loads already
Not sure I like buying spinach to accompany my meals
Smaller bags as I live alone
I'm not aware of the current cooking Spinach offered in Sainsburys.  However I prefer to have a choice of bag sizes as I'm not always able to finish a bag before it goes off.  Although I do sometimes freeze Spinach to use in smoothies.
Cheaper and mores mixed leave options
I do not buy spinach as i do not like it at all.  No matter how it is cooked.
Maybe having single serve portions which aren't expensive and aren't filled with loads of manky leaves.
I don't buy spinach anymore
